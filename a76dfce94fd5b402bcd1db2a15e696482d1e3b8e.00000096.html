                <p><b>SUMMARY</b></p>
                <p>&ldquo;What this study has shown is that overwhelmingly, in each of first three survey questions, all thirteen participants expressed the belief that Stepping Stones&rsquo; Wellness Program had greatly improved their energy, peace, health/wellness, joy/happiness, and balance levels. Furthermore, the principle that the participants wanted to improve the most prior to the program was peace and balance (40%) and Tables 1-5 all reported that the most improved principle was also peace and balance. Therefore, the outcome data suggests that the Stepping Stones&rsquo; Wellness Program is effective in improving the participant&rsquo;s specific targeted principle.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>&ldquo;In conclusion, these findings are extremely encouraging as they provide answers to important questions such as whether or not wellness programs improve the overall health of participants. Based on these results obtained from this preliminary study, Stepping Stones Wellness Program, combined with The Energy Equation System appeared to be an effective therapy for employee burnout or other energy-depleting health issue. Participants in this study documented a number of benefits from attending the workshop including: peace, energy, balance, health/wellness, and joy/happiness.&rdquo;</p>
