                <h2>Teacher Selection</h2><b>by Susan Mikolic, R.N.</b> If you were restricted to having to select only one way of helping your child succeed in school, look to teacher selection as the place to start.
                <p>A teacher alone can make or break a child's school year. Hand-selecting a teacher for a good teacher/student match is time and effort well spent and will repay you tenfold. The following personality styles often match well to the needs of a child with an emotional disturbance.</p>
                <p><b>1. Compassionate</b></p>
                <p>A compassionate personality style is of paramount importance when working with this type of child. Consider the following 2 scenarios.</p>
                <p>James is becoming overwhelmed with his day. He puts his head down on his desk during the middle of math class. This is the 3rd time he has done this today. Ms. Miller, his teacher, assigns the class to work on 2 math problems that reinforce the concept she is teaching. While the class is working on those 2 problems she moves by James' desk, crouches down next to him, and quietly, in a very caring voice, says to him, "James. Can I help you in any way? Would you like to talk? Do you need a 10 minute break?". James tells her that he is overwhelmed and feeling anxious and irritable and is having a lot of trouble functioning today. He decides that it would be helpful to go take a walk for 10 minutes. He excuses himself, and using his flexible hall pass, takes a walk down to the gym and back, stopping for a drink of water at the water fountain. He returns to class and is able to focus for the next 30 minutes.</p>
                <p>Let's now take a look at the same situation, but this time it is handled with a rigid and dispassionate personality style.</p>
                <p>James is becoming overwhelmed with his day. He puts his head down on his desk during the middle of math class. This is the 3rd time he has done this today. Ms. Harper, his teacher, stands at the front of the class and shouts to James, "James, this is the 3rd time you have refused to do work today. Go to the office right now." James, feeling humiliated and misunderstood, reports to the office where he is assigned to in-school suspension for the remainder of the day. James' stress level continues to increase as the day progresses and, feeling even more overwhelmed and irritable that earlier in the day, is unable to get any further class work done that day.</p>
                <p>A compassionate approach goes a very long way in helping these children put in place helpful strategies.</p>
                <p><b>2. Flexible</b></p>
                <p>A child with an emotional disturbance is generally well served by a teacher who is comfortable being flexible. These children have "good" and "bad" days. They need allowances made on "bad" days and opportunities to catch up on "good" days. It is helpful for them to work with someone who is comfortable making mid-course corrections to the days plan multiple times throughout the day. Of course the teacher needs to have a plan for the day/week but having that plan laid out in sand rather than stone, using it as a navigation aid versus a script.</p>
                <p><b>3. Patient</b></p>
                <p>Yes, patience is a virtue and one that serves this child well. We all know these children can be demanding and challenging. Someone who, by constitution, is a very patient person will be able to sustain compassion and flexibility much longer than others. And remaining compassionate and flexible is key to successful interactions, relationships, and functioning with these children.</p>
                <p><b>4. Structured</b></p>
                <p>In general, children with emotional disturbances maintain focus and stability better when they are surrounded by the comfort of structure, routine, and dependability. A teacher who is by nature a structured person will naturally create an environment where the child will feel more comfortable, allowing them to use their energy to stay focused on academic work.</p>
                <p><b>5. Creative</b></p>
                <p>A creative teacher will be comfortable with the alternative approaches sometimes needed to assist a child with emotional disturbances. In addition, this type of teacher could very well offer some unique options or approaches that the child/family might not have considered.</p>
                <p><b>6. Sense of Humor</b></p>
                <p>A sense of humor is a quality that serves all well. When tension is high, a witty response or the ability to laugh at the situation can immediately release the tension of a situation. Use of humor and the ability to see life a little less seriously can help temper the stress that often builds in working with this type of child.</p>
                <p><b>7. Able to Let Some Things Go</b></p>
                <p>The ability to let things go at times is carried hand-in-in hand with the ability to be flexible and patient already mentioned. Because these children can often not perform at the level of other students, it is helpful if the teacher has the ability to prioritize and let go of some things that might not be essential. Remember, the child only has <a href="stress.html">limited energy</a> to get through his day, and we need to spend this energy on high value activities...one's that will really pay off.</p>
                <p><b>8. Calm</b></p>
                <p>A calm demeanor will help everyone keep their emotions in check. A sense of calm will help to settle an emotional child when they get agitated.</p>
                <p><b>9. Positive</b> v A positive nature serves everyone well, but this quality is particularly useful when dealing with a difficult child. A positive nature will help the teacher see the opportunities in the situations that present. A positive nature will help the teacher look for the good in the child. A positive nature will sustain the teacher through difficult days.</p>
                <p><b>10. Non-confrontational</b></p>
                <p>Emotionally disturbed children can be easily agitated and often end up in conflicts. They also can struggle with that very conflict. A non-confrontational approach to situations will help children stay calm, and will also help a volatile situation from escalating.</p>
                <p>All of these qualities will serve our special child well, but if you had to pick only one or two qualities, focus your energies on connecting your child to a teacher who is compassionate and flexible.</p>
