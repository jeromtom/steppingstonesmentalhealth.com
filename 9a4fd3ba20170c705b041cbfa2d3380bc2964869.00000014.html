                <h2>Self-Advocacy<br>
                For Less Stressful School Meetings</h2><b>by Susan Mikolic, R.N.</b> Self-advocacy is a critical life skill that children with emotional disturbances would be well served to master. These children look like anyone else walking down the street. Their disabilities are typically transparent to the rest of the world. To have their needs met they must become masters of identifying what is going on, what they need, labeling what they need, and asking to receive it. The development of self-advocacy skills should be a goal for this child.
                <p>There are many ways to build these skills. A few will be offered here.</p>
                <p></p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Have the child attend their <a href="attend_meetings.html">school planning meetings</a>.
                    <p>These meetings give children an opportunity to have a hand in the development of strategies designed to help them. Who is in a better position to offer expert testimony than the child himself? These are also great opportunities to work on speaking skills as there will likely be a small group of people at this meeting and this will afford the child practice at speaking before groups of people. Take every opportunity.</p>
                    <p></p>
                  </li>
                  <li>Review the child's education plan with them.
                    <p>Even if your child attends planning sessions, be sure to review the final planning document, such as the Individualized Education Program (IEP), with your child. They should know what services and options have been planned and are available on their behalf.</p>
                    <p>Parents often look back at the end of the school year and wonder if any of the strategies that have been negotiated and accepted have ever been actually put into place. The child is in the unique position of seeing the times when these options might be useful. If they know that their plan permits the use of printing, and a teacher is relentlessly pressuring the child to offer homework or notes in manuscript, the child is now empowered to address this disparity promptly. The child, in a very respectful tone, can inform the teacher that a team of caring people convened and determined some ways to help him. One of those ways was to permit the use of printing. He can then also inform his parents upon return home so they can monitor the situation and intervene if the practice continues. If the child didn't know they had this option, and for whatever reason the parent was unaware that these demands were being placed on their child, then there are few chances to capture this opportunity to assist the child.</p>
                    <p></p>
                  </li>
                  <li>Problem-solve with your child on a daily basis as well as prior to educational planning sessions such as annual IEP meetings.
                    <p>Establish regular communication opportunities with your child to discuss ways to enhance their functioning and comfort level with their academic life. Routinely ask at breakfast or dinner, "How are things working at school? Is there any way we can make things work better for you? Are you having any problems?" And when the child answers show them how to figure out what might help. Follow-up on these issues, proving to your child that you can be trusted to be truly interested in making their situation better. As these conversations continue over time the child will begin to offer information about their dilemmas, and even have possible solutions prepared to offer. They will be learning how to problem-solve and self-advocate through this simple routine practice.</p>
                    <p>In addition to a regular communication system to discuss these issues, take full advantage of the tremendous opportunity to review all this planning on a grand scale with an IEP review. Review last years IEP<sup>1</sup> with the child and then review the draft plan for the following year. Discuss what worked well last year and what didn't. Anticipate new areas that need planning, such as the addition of lockers and locks at middle school. Plan for supportive strategies for all new situations that might be difficult for the child. <a href="transitions.html">Transitions</a> between schools, whether they be different school systems or settings or the transitions between elementary/middle school & middle/high school, need to be planned carefully.</p>
                  </li>
                </ol>
                <p>The transition to college will be a major transition. The laws governing higher education require the young adult to identify and request needed accommodations. In college the students are required to self-advocate like a master so they need to practice these skills through their school years. Furthermore, these children will need self-advocacy skills throughout their lives. Start building these skills now.</p>
