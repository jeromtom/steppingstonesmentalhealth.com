                      <h3>Susan Mikolic, RN</h3>Ms. Mikolic is President of Stepping Stones, an educational consulting business that helps educators and families understand the challenges and help emotionally disturbed children succeed in school. Her own personal struggle over many years of helping her own two children with mental disorders do well in school brought her face to face with the academic issues and deficits for these children. In 2002, Ms. Mikolic decided to start Stepping Stones so that she could help others find solutions to the problems and increase the success rate for children with emotional disturbances.
