                <h2><strong>Coaching</strong></h2>Change is a process. It will take time for you to move from living in a 'negative Energy Equation' where you experience life as draining, frustrating, and defeating, to living in a 'positive Energy Equation' where you will experience life as energizing, compelling, satisfying, and fun. Changing lifelong habits will take effort and practice.
