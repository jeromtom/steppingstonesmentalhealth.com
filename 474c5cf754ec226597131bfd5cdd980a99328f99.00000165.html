                  <li>My 12 year old daughter has depression and has trouble staying awake for the first few classes of the day at school. Is there anything we can do to help her?

                  <li>I am a middle school teacher. I have been noticing that the number of children coming into my classroom diagnosed with depression is really increasing. And sometimes I am confused by what I am seeing. The child is laughing with friends one minute and is irritable the next, but doesn't seem to be sad at all. Yet I am told they have been diagnosed with depression. How can they be laughing if they are depressed?

                  </li>
                  <li>My daughter is 12 years old and is diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder. She has been struggling in school for 2 years and generally receives D's and F's in school. I requested that the school test her. They did and said she was ineligible for special education services because she didn't have a "severe discrepancy". What does that mean & how can I get my daughter the help she needs in school? I am so worried about her.

                  <li>My son is 10 years old. He was diagnosed with Depression and Anxiety Disorder when he was 8. He struggles in school. It is hard for me to sort through the problems and possible solutions because I don't get a lot of information from the school. How can I get more communication from the school so I know what is happening there?
