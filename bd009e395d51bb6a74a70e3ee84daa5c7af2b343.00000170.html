I am so inspired by your family's ability to take such a devastating mental illness and turn it into a positive learning experience. I must congratulate Matt for allowing you to tell his story, since most of the people I have worked with who were diagnosed with mental illnesses, including Bipolar, were generally ashamed and did everything they could to hide it from anyone who didn't need to know. I hope he knows what a good thing he is doing by sharing his experiences…
                            <p>It is so important to also hear the perspective of the family and to learn how mental illness stretches beyond the individual. I feel so awful watching parents go through the initial stage of hearing such a diagnosis, and then learning how to cope and maintain normalcy, and your situation was every bit as painful. I am so happy that things worked out well for your family and that you used your experiences to help and give hope to so many others out there.</p>
                            <p>Hopefully with individuals like you and Matt out there, others won't feel so reluctant to come forward with mental illness, stigmatizations can be removed, and we can collectively continue to learn more. "</p>

                            <p>She (Sue) was very inspirational and persuasive on the fact that it is imperative that those in the educational community receive education on childhood mental illness, how the illness affects children's education, and strategies on how to support academic success for these children. This could only be accomplished by making legislative changes to reflect the criticalness of education.</p>
                            <p>A long story short - language requiring such education was included in pending legislation, the bill passed and Sue was invited to attend the signing in Columbus on March 10, 2004."</p>
