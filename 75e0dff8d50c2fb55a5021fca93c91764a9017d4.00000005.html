                <h2>Questions and Answers</h2><b><i><font face="arial,helvetica" color="#0000FF">Q:</font></i></b> I am a middle school teacher. I have been noticing that the number of children coming into my classroom diagnosed with depression is really increasing. And sometimes I am confused by what I am seeing. The child is laughing with friends one minute and is irritable the next, but doesn't seem to be sad at all. Yet I am told they have been diagnosed with depression. How can they be laughing if they are depressed?
                <p><b><i><font face="arial,helvetica" color="#0000FF">A:</font></i></b> The child may show no outward signs of a depressed MOOD, yet still have depression. Depression in children and adolescents often takes the form of irritability. Here is the criteria for a diagnosis of Major Depression:</p>
                <p>Five (or more) of the following symptoms have been present during the same 2-week period and represent a change from previous functioning; at least one of the symptoms is either (1) depressed mood, or (2) loss of interest or pleasure</p>
                <p></p>
                <ol>
                  <li>depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either subjective report (e.g., feels sad or empty) or observation made by others (e.g., appears tearful). <b>Note:</b> In children and adolescents, can be <i>irritable</i> mood.</li>
                  <li>markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of the day, nearly every day (as indicated by either subjective account or observation made by others)</li>
                  <li>significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain (e.g., a change of more than 5% of body weight in a month), or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day. <b>Note:</b> In children, consider failure to make expected weight gains</li>
                  <li>Insomnia or Hypersomnia nearly every day</li>
                  <li>psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day (observable by others, not merely subjective feelings of restlessness or being slowed down)</li>
                  <li>fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day</li>
                  <li>feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt (which may be delusional) nearly every day (not merely self-reproach or guilt about being sick)</li>
                  <li>diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day (either by subjective account or as observed by others)</li>
                  <li>recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide</li>
                </ol>
