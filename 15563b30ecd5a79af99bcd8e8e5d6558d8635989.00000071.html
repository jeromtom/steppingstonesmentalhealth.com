                <h2>Bio-Electric Shield</h2><b>Q:</b> <b>What is that necklace I always see you wearing?</b>
                <p><b>A:</b> <b>I wear a Bio-Electric Shield.</b></p>
                <p>It is a piece of jewelry that works to absorb electromagnetic frequencies that we absorb from cell phones, microwave ovens, computers, etc. Once a month you put it in the sun to discharge.</p>
                <p><img src="images/BioS_silver.gif" width="103" height="104" hspace="10" align="right">Here is what the www.healthnstuff.com site says about Bio-Electric Shields:</p>
                <p><i>"This beautiful, unusual piece of jewelry acts as an energy balancer and energetic "mirror," reinforcing your body’s natural energy field while also helping you cope with the energy overload and stress of daily life. Quartz crystals and other minerals are precision-cut and carefully arranged to stabilize your energy field.</i></p>
                <p><i>When we wear ours, we notice that we feel more balanced, focused and productive. Several systematic programs of kinesiological and meridian testing have confirmed a 100% 400% boost in measures of energetic well-being."</i></p>
                <p>You can also use another item called a Q-Link. Here is what the www.healthnstuff.com site says about Q-Links: <img src="images/Qlink.jpg" width="174" height="250" align="right" hspace="10"></p>
                <p><i>"Doctors who tested the Q-Link Pendant with Sympathetic Resonance Technology(™) found that it very quickly amplifies healthy energy states — and decreases energy drains caused by a wide variety of stressors. It is the premier product for strengthening you against direct and ambient sources of EMF, including EMF from computers and cell phones.</i></p>
                <p><i>World class athletes report that the QLink Pendant improves their mental focus and endurance, giving them a significant competitive edge. Others are enthusiastic about their new found emotional balance and stamina."</i></p>
                <p>There are also many other options beyond the bio-electric shield and Q-link such as watches and bracelets at Tools For Wellness.</p>
